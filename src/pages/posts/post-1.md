# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-09-29

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my AWS pipeline.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, then keep adding more posts. **Watch this space!**

To show how great my Markdown skills are, here is an image of a broken pipe!
